# Scripts for experiments in decemedip paper

This repository contains the code to reproduce the analyses and figures in "vmrseq: Probabilistic Modeling of Single-cell Methylation Heterogeneity". These scripts rely on the package vmrseq from [github](https://github.com/nshen7/decemedip) (v0.99.0).

The **code** directory contains scripts for preprocessing steps, the analyses with `decemedip` and other tools used in the comparisons.
